# OSM_Disaster_Resilience
Summer 2023 UVA-OSM Capstone Project


Project Description: 
Project to create tabular and interactive data to determine undermapped areas with risk of natural disasters using the Microsoft Maps Computer Vision Model (MSAI), Open Street Maps (OSM), and the National Risk Index (NRI). This is a tool to generate a metric that identifies areas across the US where preemptive mapping would be most impactful. Successfully predicting undermapped areas in the OSM database will allow volunteers to improve the data prior to a natural disaster, thus facilitating a more effective response by emergency crews and potentially saving lives.
